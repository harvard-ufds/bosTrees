`bosTrees` is a data package that contains information on trees and tree planting sites in Boston, Massachusetts. This package includes two distinct datasets, each offering unique insights into the urban forestry of Boston:

-   `bosTrees` pulls in data on 6,836 primary street trees located throughout Boston.

-   `camTrees` pulls in data on 38,050 trees and tree planting sites owned, planted or maintained by the City of Cambridge, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, and MIT, Harvard University and other private organizations

The data pulled for `camTrees` is maintained by the Cambridge Public Works and updated regularly by the City Arborist while the `bosTrees` dataset was created by the City of Boston's GIS Team.

## Installation

``` r
# Do the following once
# install.packages("devtools")

# Then, install the package
devtools::install_github("harvard-ufds/bosTrees")
```

## Example [to be edited]

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("harvard-ufds/bosTrees")
library(bosTrees)
## basic example code

exampleplot<-camTrees %>%
  filter(Longitude > -71.13, Longitude < -71.11, Latitude > 42.359, Latitude < 42.375) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = Ownership)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(-71.13, -71.11) +
  ylim(42.359, 42.375) +
  labs(title = "Ownership of Trees alongside Charles River on Harvard's Campus")

exampleplot
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
